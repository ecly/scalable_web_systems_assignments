# Assignment 01

## 1
The images are stored in a filetree structure with buckets
based on the the MGRS coordinate system. The filetree is further
structured by the Standard Archive Format for Europe (SAFE).
The metadata for the buckets is stored in .csv files within 
the structure, however do not use the metadata for anything 
directly within our code.

## 2
See code 'main.go'.

Example url:

## 3
We use the BigQuery to retrieve the folders for which we need
to retrieve the images, making our lives substantially easier.

For routing we use Gorilla, but seeing as we only route from
'/images', this is a fairly insignificant part of the assignment.

By using GoRoutines we manage to speed up our imageUrl retrieval
up considerably, as we would otherwise be fetching 100+ urls,
taking upwards 30 seconds depending heavily on the connection.

## 4
We implemented the bonus question. Below is a URL to try out:
https://ecly-178408.appspot.com/images?address=Rued+Langgaards+Vej,7,2300,København+S

Surprisingly works with spaces as well:
